#My Project is Blackjack

This should just be a simple game of blackjack. The goal is to get closer to 21 than the dealer. I have tried adding betting, but have not succeeded quite yet. Currently this game is just simple blackjack with a win/loss/push counter. How you win is to follow basic strategy (given) and get closer to 21 than the dealer. Doing so results in a win, less than the dealer is a loss, and if you and the dealer have the same number you push(tie). I will update this game in the future, as i am unhappy with this current state as well as other blackjack games offered. future updates will be:
-betting/ re-buy system
-a much more elaborate explanation for basic strategy
-mobile sizing help
